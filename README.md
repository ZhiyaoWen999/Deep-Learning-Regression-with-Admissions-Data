# Deep-Learning-Regression-with-Admissions-Data
The dataset is from Kaggle, which is Graduate Admission 2, The method use a neural network to analyze it.

For the model, I use 2 hidden layers which contain 64 and 16 neurons with RELU activation and Adam optimizer to build the neural network and to compilation. As for hyperparameter,
I gain about 78 percent score from the R-squared value of this model after try running several times. You also can try use grid search and random search to find the best hyperparameter. 
If you can find other methods to improve the score, I am looking forward to your methods.
